			<h3 class="info">About Jevon</h3>
				<p class="info">I'm a former sales professional who has always had his eye on technology. 
					Working in sales taught me the value of social skills and be able to communicate in a clear and direct manner.
					But I missed being able to collaborate with others and I figured software development would be an excellent way to do that.
				</p>
				<p class="info">At first I was trying to teach myself how to develop, but one day I came across Thinkful and I thought it would be a great way
					to streamline my web development career. 
				</p>
				<p class="info">I look forward to what we'll build together, let's get to work!</p><hr>
