			</header>
				<p class="info">I'm a former sales professional who has always had his eye on technology. 
					Working in sales taught me the value of social skills and to be able to communicate in a clear and direct manner.
					But I missed being able to collaborate with others and I figured software development would be an excellent way to do that.
					Video games, augmented reality, and virtual reality are starting to put together amazing experiences. 
					With exciting projects like this, there's no time better than now to work with a team of awesome developers. 
				</p>
				<p class="info">At first I was trying to teach myself how to develop, but one day I came across Thinkful and I thought it would be a great way
					to streamline my web development career. 
				</p>
				<p class="info">I look forward to what we'll build together, let's get to work!</p><hr>
